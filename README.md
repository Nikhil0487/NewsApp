## Design
1. MVVM architecture,
2. Storyboard based,

## Interface
1. Search for custom query,
2. Select from News API supported predefined categories for top headlines,

## Credits
This is my first iOS app. 
1. This app has huge improvements on a sample app taught in Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-mvvm-for-ios/
2. The app icon was downloaded from internet assuming it was open source, if not i am glad to remove it,
3. The News API key is used and pushed to this repo considering that this project is open source and will remain so.
